    Determines whether retrieved evidence is dominated by a single meeting.

    GOOGLE-ALIGNED RULES:
    - Uses ONLY retrieved evidence
    - Does NOT inspect the user question
    - Does NOT infer intent or scope
    - Does NOT perform routing

    DOMINANCE LOGIC:
    - Group chunks by meeting_index
    - Compute dominance ratio
    - If one meeting contributes >= 40% of chunks → dominant
    - Otherwise → evidence is mixed → return None

    Returns:
    - meeting_index (int) if dominant
    - None if no dominant meeting exists
